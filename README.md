# Holiday_Tracker
M07 Holiday Manager Assessment

The program allows users to create, remove, and find holidays in a list containing holidays from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ from 2020-2024. As well as additional holidays from holidays.json. The program allows the user to filter the list by year of week number as well as provide weather forecast from, https://community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com/forecast, which is an api for weather. The main program can be found in the holidays.py.

While using the main program, you are going to be presented a menu that will give the user the option to (1) add a holiday to the list, (2)Remove a holiday from the list, (3)Save Holiday List, (4)View Holiday List (5)Exit.

The holiday_startercode.py is the pseudo code that we got originally to structure the objects, classes, and methods. Which is the basic skelton to the main program hoilidays.py.

The holidays.json is a json file that contains 7 holidays that were requested to be added.
